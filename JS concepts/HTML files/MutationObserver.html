<!-- Imagine the situation when you need to add a third-party script that contains useful functionality, 
    but also does something unwanted, e.g. shows ads <div class="ads">Unwanted ads</div>.
Naturally, the third-party script provides no mechanisms to remove it.
Using MutationObserver, we can detect when the unwanted element appears in our DOM and remove it.
There are other situations when a third-party script adds something into our document,
 and weâ€™d like to detect, when it happens, to adapt our page, dynamically resize something etc. -->
