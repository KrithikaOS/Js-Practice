<!-- Module scripts are always deferred, same effect as defer attribute 
(described in the chapter Scripts: async, defer), for both external and inline scripts.

In other words:

downloading external module scripts <script type="module" src="..."> doesn’t block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources.
module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run.
relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first. -->


<!-- For non-module scripts, the async attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.

For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.

For example, the inline script below has async, so it doesn’t wait for anything.

It performs the import (fetches ./analytics.js) and runs when ready, even if the HTML document is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.

That’s good for functionality that doesn’t depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level event listeners. -->

<script async type="module">
    import {sayHi} from '../ModulesDemo'; import {sayHi} from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module // the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is

    /*Old browsers do not understand type="module". Scripts of an unknown type are just ignored. For them, it’s possible to provide a fallback using the nomodule attribute*/
